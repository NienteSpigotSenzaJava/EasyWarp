## Configuration

You can configure the plugin in the ```config.yml``` file, you will also find a ```warps.yml``` file, but you don't have to modify it, it only stores the warps.

Here below you can find a list of options for the plugin.

| Option                      | Default     | Description                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```cooldown```              | ```5```     | Amount of seconds to wait before the teleport after the ```/warp``` command, set it to ```0``` to disable it. |
| ```cancelTpOnMove```        | ```true```  | Cancels the teleport if the player moves after the ```/warp``` command, set it to ```false``` to disable it.  |
| ```requireWarpPermission``` | ```false``` | Requires a permission for every warp (```easywarp.warp.warpname```), set it to ```true``` to enable it.       |

## Compatibility

The plugin should work from version ```1.13.2``` to version ```1.19.4``` (latest atm), for any problem just open an issue.
